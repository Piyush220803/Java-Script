<!-- Document Object Model (DOM)
The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages 
by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory.
 Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are 
 not part of the core JavaScript language.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, 
and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them,
 you can change the document's structure, style, or content. -->
